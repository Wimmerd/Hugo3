My name is Wim Christiaens. I was born 25th of June 1972. I am a philosoper and artist living in in Ghent, Belgium. Because my name is common in my region, I sometimes use Wim A. Christiaens. 

I have a philosophy degree from the University of Ghent (1990-1994). I also did a doctorate (1999-2001) and I was a post-doctoral researcher for a while (see [here](https://www.clps.ugent.be/people/members/wim-christiaens)).

For some years now I am employed as a cleaning worker, which gives me the time to pursue philosophy, theology and drawing. 

- Some of my work in philosophy can be found on a blog: [The Ghent School for Metaphysics](https://theghentschoolformetaphysics.blogspot.com/). I continu to do philosophy on the present website (in Posts use the tage 'philosophy').

- As an artist I am an escapist. My aim is to create a fantasy world. I am working on a project called Phusiqa (see ...).

- I am a christian in the spirit of Vatican II.
