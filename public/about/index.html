I have a philosophy degree from the University of Ghent (1990-1994). I also did a PhD (1999-2001) and was a post-doctoral researcher for a while.
For some years now I am employed as a cleaning worker, which gives me the time to pursue philosophy, theology and drawing. Some of my work in philosophy can be found on a blog: The Ghent School for Metaphysics."/>
