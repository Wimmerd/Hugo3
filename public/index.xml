      <description>Best action scene: one before last episode of Sharp Objects. (Yes, I know it is a series of 2018, but in Belgium it was broadcast later.)

      <description>I am a philosoper and artist living in in Ghent, Belgium. I was born 25th of June 1972.
I have a philosophy degree from the University of Ghent (1990-1994). I also did a PhD (1999-2001) and was a post-doctoral researcher for a while.
For some years now I am employed as a cleaning worker, which gives me the time to pursue philosophy, theology and drawing. Some of my work in philosophy can be found on a blog: The Ghent School for Metaphysics.</description>
